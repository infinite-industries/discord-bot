## Scraper
  - Scrape Burl, Submit to Infinite API
  - See infinite-industries/infinite-scrapers for a jupiter notebook
  - Algorithm:
    - Fetch <a> for all upcoming events from theburl.lex
      - Fetch JSON from theburltickets.com for all events -> `burl_events[]`
        - save state - pickle, etc- to avoid superfluous refetch
    - Fetch all *upcoming* (verified and unverified) events from Infinite API:
    - Filter for events at The Burl ->  `ii_burl_events[]`
    - `burl_events.map({})`
      - next if event exists for time in `ii_burl_events[]`:
      - retrieve image, upload to our S3 bucket
        - if fail -> quit? error?
      - submit event to infinite API:
        - use our S3 image URL
        - if fail -> quit? error?
